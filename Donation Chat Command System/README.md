Simply copy the files into your mission directory, and they'll be ready to use.

initPlayerLocal allows you to define which users are able to use donation commands.

Inside the module_chatIntercept folder, commands.sqf is where chat commands are described.  Commands are automatically intercepted, so they don't show when you type them in.  You can define any command you want.  You can also directly modify the donation command to change brackets and effects.
