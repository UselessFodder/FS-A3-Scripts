	Purpose: Creates an event handler on object to detect when explosions larger
		than a hand grenade go off near it.

	Last Updated: 24 April 2023
	
	Instructions: Copy code below (without this comment into init field of object you want to
		detect the explosion.
		
		NOTE: Object must have hit detection enabled (e.g. units, vehicles, buildings with 
		damage states, objects with hit states). ROCKS WILL NOT WORK. Suggestion: Use a
		traffic cone with hideObject=TRUE near explosion detection location.
		
		NOTE2: Event Handler will execute code local to the object this is in the init
		of. If its an object in mp, that will be the host/server. If its on a unit, it 
		will be that player's local computer. If its on a vehicle, it will be the host/server
		if no player is driving OR the player's local machine if they are driving
